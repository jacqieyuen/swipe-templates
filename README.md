Swipe.js Templates
==================

I use [swipe.js](https://github.com/thebird/Swipe) for almost all my projects that need a slider. Why? Here are some great reasons:

* lightweight (16kb when *not minified*)
* touch-capable (literally swipe!)
* cross browser (IE 7+)
* no dependencies (no jQuery needed)

## Note

I am using my version of the swipe.js library. It includes some fixes by the community.

### Default

The default setup.

### Wrapped with links

The default setup but the slides are wrapped with links.

### Pagination

Using a pagination to control which slide to go to and also an indicator.

### Thumbnails

Nice fat thumbnails for clicking on. Same purpose of the pagination.

### 3-Up

3 images in one slide.
